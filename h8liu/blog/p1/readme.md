# Begin

I finally decided to seriously start my own tech blog, and it starts from here.

Linus Torvalds once said *Talk is cheap. Show me the code.* Carrying this
kind of hard-core hacker spirit, this blog will focus on __code__.

And by __code__, I do not mean short texts that happened to be rendered in 
monospace fonts, I do not mean crappy example files that require a
3GB IDE to compile and run, I do not mean GitHub projects that you
have to pray after typing `./configure` and `make`.

None of that!

By __code__, I mean real, compiled, readable code that instantly runs
inside my blog posts.

Right here.

*(add a running piece of code here)*

Welcome to Lonnie's world of programming!
